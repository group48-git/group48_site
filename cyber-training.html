			<p>Companies want to innovate. But, innovation is wasted if you can’t follow through with execution. To realise the return on a stroke of genius, an organisation must move a project from conception to market. They must be willing to scrap ideas, no matter how brilliant, if they don’t align with the organisation’s overall strategy. Innovation most often succeeds – and earns a return on investment – when it is part of an organisation’s culture. So, what separates an innovative company from its peers?</p>
			<p>Building Innovation from the Business Unit Up: The Steps You’re Not Taking are Holding You Back discusses:</p>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">The seven common characteristics of truly innovative companies</p>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">The impact of poor project leadership on innovation, and how to change it</p>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">Questions to ask to measure if your company is ready to innovate</p>
			<br>
			<p>One of the strategic priorities for a business leader is to drive innovation — but a key pain point and barrier to achievement is a lack of ability to do that, hindered by a variety of challenges that span everything from resourcing concerns to process failure. This piece offers guidance on the steps most leaders miss that will greatly improve their ability to drive innovation at the business unit level.</p>
			<p>Your enterprise needs constant innovation. We help you stand out and speed up your innovation by being disruptive. Need to innovate faster and more cost-effectively? We are here to help. From turning ideas into prototypes, to understanding what emerging technologies are available, to aligning innovation with business priorities, making innovation a part of your DNA, to testing ideas on real customers without putting your brand at stake.</p>

			<h4>Cyber exercise for management</h4>
			<br>
			<p>A cyber attack is a business event, and not merely a technological one. There is a significant need to manage an attack as its consequences can be devastating to the company, to the point of closure.</p>
			<br>
			<p>One of the main outcomes of a cyber attack on an organization is uncertainty, which leads to chaos and therefore decisions made under pressure that may lead to undesirable results, losses to the company, loss of trust of customers and stakeholders, and exposure of senior executives to personal lawsuits. The variety of doctrines and facades with which an organization's management is required to deal in a complex and often technological event is not the primary aspect of such an event, but rather it’s the business, legal, or media aspect. A systematic, calculated process - in constant consultation with expert lawyers, proper media handling, customers, and the regulatory aspect - is necessary in order to survive such an event. This prevents loss of customer trust and exposing the company and its senior executives to lawsuits.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Goals: Training company management to prepare for the cyber event and its implications on the basis of several parameters:</p>
			<br>
			<ul class="bulleted">
				<li><p class="tabbed">Familiarity with relevant reference scenarios for the company.</p></li>
				<li><p class="tabbed">Dealing with response to the event in real time.</p></li>
				<li><p class="tabbed">Making decisions during a state of uncertainty.</p></li>
				<li><p class="tabbed">Dealing with the event from all perspectives (communications, clients, regulation, insurance, law enforcement, etc.)</p></li>
				<li><p class="tabbed">Recovery and return to routine.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>This process will help employees identify gaps in security and draw conclusions from the effects of a cyber event.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>Physical Social Engineering Exercise</h4>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">1. Infiltration into the organization's offices.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">2. Establishing fictitious booths to obtain employee information.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">3. Fictitious job interviews.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">4. VISHING.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This incorporates a variety of physical exercises aimed at extracting information from employees in different ways. It should be emphasized that the product does not include simmering and its purpose is to examine how the company is exposed through the conduct of its employees, under the manipulation of social engineering. One of the courses is a presentation on this subject, given to management staff and employees.</p>
